A raymarching renderer


I wrote my own libraries for several things, including vector maths, to see if I could. 

The renderer is not particularly physically accurate, especially in the fog rendering - this really ought to be in a skycolour() function. 

Much of the raymarching and rendering was written following articles written by the brilliant Inigo Quilez (iquilezles.org). 

Since creating decent images requires much iteration, I set up a system to make, run, convert images and back them up. This is run.sh, 
and uses my own ppmtopng, in its own repo. This also backs up code versions. It's not particularly efficient - proper use of 
git would be much better - but it works. It's not too bad, ~800 past images take up about 200MB.
